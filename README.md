StringsUtil provides a library for using Apple strings file and a utility for
creating and merging strings from C code.


Requirements
------------

You'll need a C compiler.


How to Incorporate in Your Project
----------------------------------

Add the `strings.c` and `strings.h` files to your project.  Include the `mmd.h`
header in any file that needs to read/convert markdown files.


"Kicking the Tires"
-------------------

The supplied makefile allows you to build the unit tests on Linux and macOS (at
least), which verify that all of the functions work as expected to produce a
HTML file called `testmmd.html`:

    make test

The makefile also builds the `mmdutil` program.


Installing `mmdutil`
--------------------

You can install the `mmdutil` program by copying it to somewhere appropriate or
run:

    make install

to install it in `/usr/local` along with a man page.
