StringsUtil provides a library for using Apple ".strings" localization files and
a utility for managing those files.  It is intended as a free, smaller,
embeddable, and more flexible alternative to GNU gettext.  Key features include:

- Support for localizing using both Apple ".strings" and GNU gettext ".po"
  files.
- Simple C/C++ library with support for embedding localization data in an
  executable and/or loading localizations from external files.
- Tools for exporting, importing, and merging localization files.
- Tool for reporting on the quality of a localization.
- Tool for scanning C/C++ source files for localization strings.
- *FUTURE*: Tool for doing a first pass machine translation.


Requirements
------------

You'll need a C compiler and the CUPS library.


"Kicking the Tires"
-------------------

The supplied makefile allows you to build the unit tests on Linux and macOS (at
least), which verify that all of the functions work as expected:

    make test

The makefile also builds the `stringsutil` program.


Installing
----------

Run:

    make install

to install it in `/usr/local` along with a man page.


Using the `stringsutil` Tool
----------------------------

Create a ".strings" file by scanning source files in the current directory:

    stringsutil -f base.strings scan *.[ch]

Create a ".po" file for external localizers to work with:

    stringsutil -f base.strings export es.po

Import the ".po" file when the localizer is done:

    cp base.strings es.strings
    stringsutil -f es.strings import es.po

See how well the localizer did:

    stringsutil -f base.strings report es.strings

Update the ".strings" file for changes to the source files:

    stringsutil -f base.strings scan *.[ch]

Merge those changes into the "es.strings" file:

    stringsutil -f es.strings -c merge base.strings
